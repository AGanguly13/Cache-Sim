# Cache-Sim

The goal of this assignment is to help you understand caches better. 
You are required to write a cache simulator using the C programming language. 
The programs have to run on iLab machines. 
We are providing real program memory traces as input to your cache simulator. 
The format and structure of the memory traces are described below.
